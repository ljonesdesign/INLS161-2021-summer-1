1. We will go back and go over some inline css. This is a great way to make it so you can have a different color scheme for each page. 

2. Then we will go on to look at some one page templates, so you can decide if you might want to use a one page template for your final project. 

3. Next Tuesday, we will pickup where we left off and continue working with your task 02.03 project.

4. We won't do any command line practice today, but I do want to mention that I am starting to get into the habit of using the Visual Studio Code Terminal almost exclusively for my personal Command Line connections. So from now on, I will be using VS Code for command line demos in future classes. We will not do much, if any, command line for the rest of the class.

**NEW!**

I have added  few links to some nice templates at the [bottom of the templates page](../web-dev/templates#new-templates-suggestions-as-of-summer-school-session-1).
