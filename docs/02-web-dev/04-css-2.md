1. We will go back and go over some inline css. This is a great way to make it so you can have a different color scheme for each page. 

2. Then we will go on to look at some one page templates, so you can decide if you might want to use a one page template for your final project. 

3. Next Tuesday, we will pickup where we left off and continue working with your task 02.03 project.

**NEW!**

I have added  few links to some nice templates at the [bottom of the templates page](../web-dev/templates#new-templates-suggestions-as-of-summer-school-session-1).
