This is a long Memorial Day Weekend. No class on Monday, May 31. We will begin to work with templates on Tuesday June 1.

We will go over Templates and Scripting on Tuesday and Wednesday. You should be able to post a reasonably good draft of your final website by the end of class on Wednesday (you may have until the end of the day if needed). You can continue to work on your site for the remainder of Summer Session 1 and request feedback before the end of the semester. 

We will begin the Documents project on next Wednesday and finish it by Friday.
