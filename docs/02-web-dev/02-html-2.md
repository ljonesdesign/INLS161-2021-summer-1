I have taken part of the Templates activity and moved it here. Some students in past semesters have really had a hard time with advanced templates, so we need to cover this EZ template before the weekend. That way, we can keep the stress levels down next week for students that might have a hard time with more difficult templates. You will be able to build your final project off of this template if you like.

:::warning
Your home page, or initial page should always be named ```index.html```. the ```"i"``` should be lower case and html should be lowercase. Don't name it ```index1.html``` or ```2index.html```. Don't ever have a page named ```home.html```. Your **home** page **is** the ```index.html``` page. If you name it with a capital ```"I"``` like this,```Index.html```, OPAL will not hide it in the directory. It will be listed like any other non ```index.html``` file.

## Navigation

Navigation design basics are the most crucial next step to learn after getting HTML structure down. Navigation design is complicated. Especially when building responsive sites. We don't have time to go into the fine details, but I do want to go over some absolute basics. You do not have to follow along with me, but I will create a project and demonstrate this in class. It's your choice follow along or just watch. If you complete this task and post it on opal it will give you credit for both task 02.01 and 02.02, so if you are behind, you can get caught up today.

## EZ Template

We are going click over to my [EZ-template Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ljonesdesign/EZ-template) and download that template. The sample site has four working pages. The template only has a working home page which is the ```index.html``` file. The goal of this exercise and practice is to show you how to create multiple pages from this template or any other template. You will see how the CSS file controls all of the colors and fonts to customize the template to suit your needs. 

I will encourage you to make your site colors and typography easy to read and meet accessibility guidelines.
