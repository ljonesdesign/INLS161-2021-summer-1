You should read this page before class and make some choices.

You are going to need to [choose a book](http://www.gutenberg.org). If you choose from any of the most recent 1000 books below, you will be assured that no previous student has ever submitted a book from that list. Be sure to understand that it is a violation of the UNC Honor Code to submit any duplicate project file that has been previously completed and submitted in any previous INLS 161 course or recitation. I trust that all students are honorable and will have fun with formatting their own book.

[Project Gutenberg Newest Releases](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=release_date) Here is a list of the latest 1,000 recent additions. It's kind of fascinating to see what volunteers have been working on over the last six months. Find anything that you like but you should **not go for books with fewer that 8 chapters or more than 15 chapters** and stay away from oddly formatted text or poetry. You want clean blocks of text; You will not attempt to include any graphics or photos from the book, so you should stay away from books that are mostly graphically in nature. It is okay to choose a book with some photos, but the text format you choose will not have the photos included.

## New Macintosh Setup Videos
The most frustrating part of this project for Mac Users is the setup because the user interface is very different from the PC demonstration. If you are Mac User you should [watch this video for set up](https://uncch.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=006426fe-d9b2-4199-b61f-acef01580330) and not try to follow along with the PC demo in class.
