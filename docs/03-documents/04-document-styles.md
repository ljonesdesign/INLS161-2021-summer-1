## Task 3.07 Make all Primary Text
Select all text and apply the ```Task03Content``` style

## Task 3.08.01 Footnotes Style
Create a new style called **Task03Footnotes** based on the Task03Content style,
1. with a **serif** font of your choosing
2. 10 points
3. auto spacing before and after
4. single line spacing
5. no first line indentation

## Task 3.08.02 Insert Footnote
Insert a Footnote and Format it with the style that you just created.
If you have any footnotes in the document, format them in your new Task03Footnotes style.
If you don't, you still need to create the new style and insert a footnote that includes the words *an example of the new footnote style* somewhere in the document
To insert a footnote click your cursor into the text at the end of a sentence or at a word that you might want to footnote. **Do not put your footnote in the footer.** The footnote will be automatically created for you at the bottom of the page, *above the footer*.

If you did not catch this in class you can see a demo on Lynda.com. As a UNC student you have access to this [footnote video](https://www.lynda.com/Word-tutorials/Create-footnote-endnote/664807/736011-4.html) All you need to see about footnotes is in the first two or three minutes of the video.

## Task 3.09 Modify Title style
Modify the Title style to:
* 16 point
* sans serif font of your choosing
* black color
* center alignment

## Task 3.10 Modify the Subtitle style
Modify the Subtitle style to serif font of your choosing,
black color, center alignment.
*if you want to have your title or subtitle in a color other than black, you may do so, but tell me about it in a footnote.*

## Task 3.11 Format Title
On the first page of the document, format the words in the title in the Title style.
If there is a subtitle, format it in the Subtitle style.

## Task 3.12 Chapter Headings
Format the name of each section that precedes the chapters of the document (such as Preface, Forward, etc. if the work has any) and the title of each chapter in Heading 2 style (these will be used later for the real table of contents). If you have any text sections that follow the chapters, format them in the same Heading 2 style.  You will have multiple sections and chapter titles to format appropriately. You can productively use your CNTL+F tool here. If your work also has chapter numbers, format each chapter number in Heading 1 style. If your work has no chapter titles, format the chapter number in the Heading 2 style.
