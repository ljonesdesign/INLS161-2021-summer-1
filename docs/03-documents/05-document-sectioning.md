## Task 3.13 Section Breaks

Insert appropriate **section breaks** so that each separate element of the
work (preface, chapters, endnotes, if any) starts on new page. (Use your document map and your keyboard shortcuts to speed the process).

**DON'T USE PAGE BREAKS! Your headers have to change at each chapter. If you use page breaks, you will go in an endless loop trying to get it to work.**


## Task 3.14 Delete ToC

If your downloaded book has a table of contents included in it, delete it because you will replace it with a new Table of Contents.


## Task 3.15 Create ToC Page

After the title page and prior to the first section of the book, add a section break that will make the following page start on new page between the title page and the first chapter and put the words "**Table of Contents**" formatted as a Heading 3 atop this page. Do not try to create your table of contents yet!
