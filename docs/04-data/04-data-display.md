## General Observations
Creating charts begins as if you were preparing to sort or filter. Therefore, start by selecting all **adjacent** data exactly as you did with sorts and filters. Even if the instuctions are asking you to only show one or two columns of data, select all the columns. This will work for our our project because there are not too many columns. **We can use the Chart Wizard to deselect the columns we don't want to show.**

However, this is not a good approach if you have data that has very many columns and you just need to select a few. In those cases, you will need to select **non-adjacent** data.

Here is a link from Microsoft which goes into greater depth on the different ways to [select data for charts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/select-data-for-a-chart-in-excel-for-mac-22157ba1-9475-45b2-9cc4-f84abaff1b67).

## 18-Chart 1 Data: Compare Value to Categories

### Learning objectives: Duplicate Worksheet, Select/Sort Data, Create Chart, remove unneeded data, format chart

There are a lot of steps in creating a chart in Excel, but once you get the idea of how and why, it only takes a short time to make a chart and is very, very easy.


### Prepare the Data for the Chart 1-5.

>Numbers of Persons Serving in the Korean War is fine for the chart title on the resultant chart, but it will not fit on the worksheet tab name at the bottom of the workspace, so name it  ```Korean War Chart``` on the tab.

1. Copy a sheet rename it by right clicking on the Worksheet and choose copy.
2. Move the new sheet to the end of the worksheets.
3. Identify the label data.
4. Identify the numerical data.
5. After the data is identified, Sort or Filter ALL the data. (This is a preview of the data tools session for next week.) You must make sure you sort all the related data.

### Select the Data for the Chart, Create the Chart, Move the Chart to a New Worksheet

Select the cells you need. You will have to limit what you select so that only the data you need is shown in the chart. There are multiple ways to limit what you select.

The most powerful way to do this is counter intuitive: you select more than you need and then you turn off the data columns you don't want to show using chart tools via a right click.

1. Use the Chart wizard to easily make a chart.
2. Right click on a blank part of the chart to get a popup window to move the chart to a new sheet.
3. Name the sheet as directed. Name the tab with the Shorter Name.
4. Format the chart to personalize the colors, type etc.

Below is a general overview of what we are doing.

## 19-Chart 2 Data: Compare Value Percentage to Categories

We will repeat all of the same steps we did in Chart One, but we will have two columns of data instead of one, so we will have to create different type of chart, a **100% Stacked Chart**.  we don&#39;t have to do a sort or a filter.

After we get the chart on a new sheet, we will format it and include a free-floating object.
