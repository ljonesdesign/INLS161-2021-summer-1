This session is being revised. It will be similar to the below examples.

## Sort: single level

1. Sort the data rows on the ```13-sort NC ZIP codes``` worksheet by ZIP Code.
2. Have the sort display from smallest to the largest.

## Sort: multi-level

1. Sort the data rows on the ```14-SORT STATE, THEN YEAR``` worksheet
2. first by **State** alphabetically (from A to Z)
3. and then by **Year completed** from SMALLEST to largest.

## Filter: single level

1. Filter the data on the```15-Filter Disabled Workers``` worksheet to find the **bottom three Congressional Districts** in terms of **Disabled Workers**
2. Do not sort the results. Simply show the results of filtering out all but the bottom three districts.

## Filter: multi-level (1 of 2)

1. Use a multilevel filter on the ```16-Language Preferences``` worksheet to find out which of the languages whose names start with the **letter A only**
2. had **Receipt Count (excluding 53rd week) between 1000 and 4000**

## Filter: multi-level (2 of 2)

Filters are powerful. Do another one:

1. Use a multilevel filter on the ```17-Year & ResidentialCustomer``` worksheet to find out which of the **Month of PeriodEndDate** only in **March**
2. had an **above average ResidentialCustomerCount**

## Pivot Table
