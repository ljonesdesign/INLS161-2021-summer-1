## Spreadsheet Overview

We will glance over the [Spring 2021 lecture notes](https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2021_spring/inls161_001/11a.01.preps.html).

**Just discovered this:** the University of Michigan Library has a very nice [Excel Overview](https://guides.lib.umich.edu/excel)

## Data Module Task 04 Overview

You are to download (see below) and modify several existing worksheets to make them a more useful product. To be specific, these worksheets are collected from a variety of publicly available data provided by the US government in spreadsheet form.

The 04-task will require you show capability with a number of data management skills

* [cell and worksheet](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/quick-start-format-a-worksheet-d70f75a2-23e6-4c92-83d6-2f219e4ad42e) formatting

* converting raw data into [charts/data displays](https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Video-Create-charts-231c42d2-5e58-40e1-99f0-cbe618cfee1d)

* [sorting](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sort-data-in-a-range-or-table-62d0b95d-2a90-4610-a6ae-2e545c4a4654) - simple and multivalue
* [filtering](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/filter-data-in-a-range-or-table-01832226-31b5-4568-8806-38c37dcc180e) - simple and multivalue

* We will **not** use manually entered headers and footers in this task. You will use [Page Layout](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/page-setup-71c20d94-b13e-48fd-9800-cedd1fec6da3). Also, do not change the view of your worksheets to print view. Just enter the settings in the Page Layout dialog boxes. I will be able to find them and grade them. Submitting your project in print view will break all of the frozen panes and complicate my grading workflow. **All worksheets in your workbook should be in grid view only**.

Additionally, we will introduce basic database concepts

 * we will gain a familiarity with Entity Relationship Model concepts and terminology
 * we will gain a familiarity with Structured Query Language (SQL) queries

## Today's Session

For this session you will need to download the following: 

* the grade sheet: [task04.gradesheet-2021-ss1.xlsx](https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/495258d0-d1a8-4987-a9b4-330863ce1068/task04.gradesheet-2021-ss1.xlsx) The grade sheet may be enough direction for students that have substantial skills, but those students that do not attend class or watch the videos do not usually get all the tasks done correctly.
* the more-detailed powerpoint instructions for today: [formatting-functions-formulas-2021-ss1.pptx](https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/495258d0-d1a8-4987-a9b4-330863ce1068/formatting-functions-formulas-2021-ss1.pptx)
* the workbook with the worksheets that you will edit and submit for final grading: [task04-worksheet-2021-SS1.xlsx](https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/495258d0-d1a8-4987-a9b4-330863ce1068/task04-worksheet-2021-SS1.xlsx)
