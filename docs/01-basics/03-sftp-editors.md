### Recommended SFTP Programs

Use any SFTP you like. Here are my personal preferences for teaching:

**PC:** I like WinSCP for Windows because it is free and Open Source shareware, and has no adware. You can [download WinSCP with this link](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php). *Don't click the "get it with from Microsoft" link unless you want to help fund the open source project by paying $10.* 

> There is no registration code to enter for this package, and it does not have an ending trial period.

**Mac:** I like Fetch for the Mac because UNC has a Use License and I have a lot of experience with using it for teaching. Here is the [UNC Software download link for Fetch](https://software.sites.unc.edu/fetch-download/). Make sure to look for this:

**Serial Number Name:** UNC-Chapel Hill

**Serial Number:** (The download page will show you the Serial number) 

> It is long and hard to type, so copy-paste into Fetch.


# SFTP Process

Click the Fetch Mac Graphic below to see how the SFTP process works. This presentation will be helpful to review even if you are using a different Mac SFTP client app or if you are using a PC app. 

:::tip
If you are not using Fetch or you are using a PC, skip to [slide 16](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QGQjVMvFS3-lIgMI4BoESXnRnmit-cV2_5p-5dYlFhU/edit#slide=id.gbc088c0537_2_239).

## Recommended Text Editor

Use any Text Editor you like. My personal preference for teaching for both **PC and Mac** is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This will be the best option for you if you do not already have a favorite editor. I do not recommend using textEdit on the Macintosh or Notepad on the PC or other very basic editors unless you are an advanced coder. (Notepad++ is an acceptable text editor).

## Starters

Hoping to have two or three of you do a starter this morning.
