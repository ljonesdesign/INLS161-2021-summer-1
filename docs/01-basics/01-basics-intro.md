We will spend some time today to get to know each other..

## First tool: Browser

The recommended browser for Sakai is [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is also a good choice. You will need a web browser for testing your website; either of these will work just fine. Avoid using Mac specific (Safari) or Windows specific (Edge or Explorer) browsers as a primary testing tool for web development. 

## Sakai


> **These tasks will be our main focus in the recitations**. You should look at the Lessons page before each recitation and be aware of the tasks we are planning to work on for that day.

**Assignments:** This is where you submit your work. Pay attention to the due dates. It is important for you not to fall behind or you will get overwhelmed with a backlog of work. **If you attend the recitations, you will most likely be able to keep up with your work.**



## Forum Posts
VALUE ADDED ITEM | .5 each

**Forum posts 1-8:** You do not have to submit forum postings in the Assignment Section. Just put your forum post in the appropriate folder for your section. I will find and grade your posts from the forum.

:::tip
The folder is labeled with the forum number and your name is always next to your post title. Therefore, from an information sharing standpoint, including your name and forum post number in the title is not necessary and it obfuscates what the reader most needs&mdash;the title.
:::

## Comment on Peer's post
VALUE ADDED ITEM | 3 points

In Figure 1 above notice the black triangle to the left of the Post Title. This indicates that there is at least one comment on that post. **You should make at least one comment on a peer's post sometime this semester.**  There is no need to submit this in the assignment section. I will find your comments and grade them in the process of reading the forums.

## Starter
VALUE ADDED ITEM | 3 points

During the semester I will ask each of you to present one of your forum posts at the start of each class. Some of you will need to step up and get this done early and others will need to present at later dates. A starter has a chain of prerequisites that are not very time consuming, but they have to be done in this order:

1. You need to subscribe to a tech newsletter
2. You need to get a newsletter in your inbox
3. You need to scan over some articles
4. Choose to read one article that catches your attention
5. This is not a formal report. You do not have to summarize the article. Some of the articles can be rather long. Write a short forum post on why you find this article interesting and how it relates to your interests, or passions, or concerns.

### Why we do this:

#### Big Payoff

You at a job interview:

> **Interviewer:** How do you keep up with technology?

> **You:** I subscribe to MIT Technology Review.

> **Interviewer:** What is something that you found interesting?

> **You:** (thinking over your posts...) Google Achieving Quantum Supremacy.....

#### Other Things

Or maybe you notice something that inspires you to build a project, or pursue a particular job, or an advanced degree.

## Professionalism
VALUE ADDED ITEM | 5.5 points

[Characteristics of Professionalism](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/characteristics-professionalism-1209.html)

Everything in this class is about empowering you to meet the complex demands of these very challenging times. This grade is not to cause you to worry or be anxious. Think of it as a gift. It is 5.5 points that you don't have to earn. Just be nice, kind, and communicative. Professionalism does not equal perfectionism.

> To err is human, to forgive is divine.


## Task 01.01 

### Create your first forum posting

Your initial posting should be a repeat of what you will do in the first lab/recitation session. Include it it at least the following:

1. your name and the name you prefer to be called
2. your hometown (in whatever manner you chose to define the word "hometown")
3. your class (first year, second, third, fourth, graduate student)
4. your major
5. what you hope to get out of this class
6. and, the operating system on your personal laptop

Of course, you may add anything else that you wish.

## Task 01.03

#### We need to set up our laptops to be able to fully engage in client-server relationships on the UNC network

#### Off-campus access to the UNC networks requires the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) provides an encrypted connection (secure tunnel) from off campus to the UNC-Chapel Hill internal network. VPN allows you to access campus applications and work securely, just as if you were physically on campus. Access to some campus applications from off campus require the use of VPN (i.e., [Virtual Computing Lab](https://vcl.unc.edu/index.php?mode=selectauth), [Virtual Lab](https://uncch.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010180&sys_kb_id=941ef66bdb6800901fb6ef070596190f), and [ConnectCarolina](https://connectcarolina.unc.edu/)).

Go to [ITS's VPN installation page](https://help.unc.edu/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=87af20281b7f4c90b7de21b5ec4bcb99), determine your client's operating system, and then download and install the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client that is appropriate for your laptop, tablet, and/or phone.

![VPN login](/img/vpn.png)

When you have successfully installed it on your device, put a screenshot of the installation in your [assignments space](https://sakai.unc.edu/x/EvvsGz) in Sakai to let us know that you have it.

### We may as well begin here to use a consistent file naming convention.

The structure takes advantage of how operating systems want to index things.

##### Things to remember about naming your files and directories

To do

*   A good format for dates in YYYYMMDD. This format ensures that your files automatically sort in chronological order.
*   Try to make filenames as short as possible, while remaining meaningful.
*   Use capital letters to delimit words, as in `````UseCapitalLettersToDelimitWords```.
*   Always use leading zeroes in a sequence of numbers, so the sequence will read 01, 02, 03, 11 and not 1, 11, 2, 3.

**NOT to do**

*   Even if your operating system allows you, do not save files containing these characters <span class="attention">~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; > < ? , [ ] { } ' " |</span> . You may encounter difficulties searching for or opening them
*   Do not leave spaces in filenames.  
  
    Some software will not recognize file names with spaces.
