Carefully following the grading rubric allows you to do very well on this project even if being creative is challenging for you.
There is an expanded checklist on the previous class page. Make sure to download the [Excel grade sheet for point values](https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/attachment/8f9c1dbd-3e27-400a-bdae-29608fa12361/Assignments/e5499e5d-2705-4760-9c56-4fc4ee0561fd/task05.gradesheet.xlsx) This file contains points for both sessions.

## Final Tips

* Try out your presentation in advance
* check to see if the timings of the transitions and animations will work for the audience
* pay particular attention to how much time it takes for animations to occur
* remember that most audiences do not have a lot of time to spend waiting for things to happen
* The eye can see and understand concepts very quickly.
* The quicker your presentation can **get in**,
* **make a positive impression**, 
* and **get out**, the better off you will be.
* don't talk over a blank screen...start out every slide with somthing for the viewer to focus on

## Key principles to consider

* focus on the audience's needs and build your visuals to conform to their expectations and your message
* simple and effective is preferable to complex and confusing
* bullets are okay on this page as they serve as a "to do" list, but avoid bullets in presentations.

## Rules to live by

1. Hammer it home
2. tell them what you're going to tell them
3. tell them
4. tell them what you told them
5. Less is More

Watch it on your own.
