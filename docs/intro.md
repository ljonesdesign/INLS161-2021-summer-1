# Start Here

Welcome to INLS 161 Summer Session One, 2021! This site will serve as the focus of our session lessons. Log into Sakai to view the syllabus and other resources. 

## Left Sidebar

### Responsive Site
>If you are not able to see the left sidebar, you may need to make your browser window larger, or full screen. 


This site is responsive; that means that it adapts to work on different screen sizes. If you are viewing this site on a phone, you will need to click the menu icon in the bottom right of screen to access the lessons menu.

###  Five Modules

The course is divided into five modules. Modules do not fit neatly into each week, so you will notice some "weekend" links. This weekend links will provide you with a recap of the previous week and give you reminders of any assignments that are due that weekend or the upcoming week.

## Right Sidebar
The right sidebar will allow you to quickly find any section on an individual page. The right sidebar is not available at smaller screen sizes.

## Top Navigation Bar
>If you are not able to see the top menu bar because your screen is not large enough, you will need to click the menu icon in the top left of the screen.

### Assignments
In the Top Navigation bar you will see the assignment links. All of the assignments are explained in the lesson sessions which are in the left sidebar. The assignment links will give you a quick way to jump to any assignment directions. 

## Corporate Training Model
I am an adjunct instructor and also work as a corporate trainer, so I will conduct this course much like a corporate training course. The goal for corporate training is to focus on the "need-to-know" skills and not focus as much on the "nice-to-know" concepts.  

**This is a technology tools class.** In each class we will spend a few minutes covering a information tools concept and then you will perform an activity that will count towards your task completion. We will review that task then move to the text concept and repeat the process. *Disclaimer: There will be a few areas where we will need to discuss global concepts that will not have associated tasks.*

**This is also a soft skills class.** There is also an expectation that corporate trainers evaluate not only student skills, but knowledge and attitudes. Your grades will be a reflection of your skills, but how you compare to your peers makes a difference. Whenever I must submit a recommendation letter for a student, I must answer questions regarding attitude and skills. This is the same for a corporate trainer. They are often asked to provide this type of feedback to managers.


SILS wants you to be successful in your future work environments. Therefore, you will have opportunities to resubmit work for full credit if it is done in a timely manner.

We will not have required team projects, but you may work on some of the projects in teams, and we will have some group projects that will be low stakes grades in this session. 

Students that faithfully attend class will do well. Students that must miss a class will have access to the recorded sessions. 

## Attendance

**Summer school moves very quickly!** Summer School administration expect students to attend all synchronous classes. This is not an asynchronous class. During the fall and spring semesters there is more flexibility for INLS 161 students to adopt a HyFlex approach regarding attendance, but this is a poor strategy for summer classes.

 * **I have set up this course so that students who attend class will be completely successful. This is confirmed over a four year career of teaching this class.**

If you plan to attend all classes you can skip over all of these bullets. If you miss a class be sure to scan them. 

* If you cannot attend most of the classes, you will need excellent self-directed learning skills, and you will need to have significant prior tech experience. You will also not be able to receive the in-class value added grading items.

* Therefore, you should try to make all classes. There are no shortcuts; you must come to class. 

* **As of Summer I, we are back to normal grading (no CV grades, and no COVID pass/fail grading).**

* I will not be able to work one-one-one with you in office hours and compress the material anymore than it is delivered in the class recording. 

* So if you must miss class you should watch, or least scan over the captions in the the Panopto video before scheduling office hours. 
However, if you need general help, or help accessing the Panopto videos, then do reach out to me.

## Teaching Philosophy
I recently completed my Master Degree in Adult Education in Training and Development. I do not see myself as an authoritarian, but as a facilitator. Therefore, I do not require excuses or letters from doctors, etcetera. I will be as flexible with you as possible, but it is very difficult to catch up if you fall behind in summer school.
